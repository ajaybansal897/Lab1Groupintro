This is our first collaborated work on the Git Hub. Git hub is a great online tool to work simultaneously on different modules.
This help us to work as an independent resource as one person is completely dedicated to his own work. Also it provides us to integrate 
all the modules and merge the code written by different coders as a single master code. Moreover this tool provide us to reuse the code as we can make 
several branches from a master code.
